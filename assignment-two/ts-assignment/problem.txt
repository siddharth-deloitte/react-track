You are given an object literal representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.
(The collection is in the albums.ts file)

You start with an "updateRecords" function that takes an 
- "RecordCollection" object (which contains the musical album collection),
- an id of "Number" type,
- a prop (like artist or tracks), and 
- a value "string" or "number". 
Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

Your function must always return the entire record collection object.
If prop isn't "tracks" and value isn't an empty string, update or set that album's prop to value.

If prop is "tracks" and value isn't an empty string, add value to the end of the album's existing tracks array.

Example
If updateRecords is called with parameters 
updateRecords(recordCollection, 5439, "artist", "Sonu")
"artist" field in the 5439 record should be the string "Sonu"

As this is a Typescript assignment all the parameters are required to have types and avoid using "any"
